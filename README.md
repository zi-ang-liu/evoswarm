# EvoSwarm
EvoSwarm is a Python library for evolutionary and swarm intelligence algorithms. 
It provides simple implementations of the most common algorithms.

* Simple implementation
* * only numpy and matplotlib required
* * Two-file structure: one for the algorithm, one for the problem

## Algorithms implemented
* Differential Evolution
* Particle Swarm Optimization
* Genetic Algorithm
