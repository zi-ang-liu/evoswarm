# EvoSwarm
EvoSwarm is a Python library for evolutionary and swarm intelligence algorithms. 
It provides simple implementations of common algorithms.

* Simple implementation
  * only requires the most basic Python libraries (numpy, matplotlib)
  * Two-file structure: one for the algorithm, one for the problem

## Algorithms implemented
* Differential Evolution
* Particle Swarm Optimization
* Genetic Algorithm

## Benchmark problems implemented
  * continuous optimization
    * Sphere function
    * Ackley function
    * Rastrigin function
  * discrete optimization
    * Travelling salesman problem
